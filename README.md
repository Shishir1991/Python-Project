Descriptive Statistics with Python

This Python project aims to provide a comprehensive toolkit for performing descriptive statistics analysis using Python. 
Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, researcher, or student, this library offers a range of functionalities to explore, summarize, and visualize your data effectively.

Features

Basic Statistics: Compute common descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
Distribution Analysis: Explore the distribution of your data through histogram plotting, density estimation, and probability distribution fitting.
Central Tendency Measures: Calculate various measures of central tendency including arithmetic mean, weighted mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean.
Variability Measures: Assess the variability of your data with range, interquartile range (IQR), and coefficient of variation.
Correlation Analysis: Examine the relationship between variables with correlation coefficients, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
Outlier Detection: Identify outliers in your dataset using z-score, Tukey's fences, and modified z-score methods.
Data Visualization: Visualize your data distributions, relationships, and summary statistics through intuitive plots and charts.
